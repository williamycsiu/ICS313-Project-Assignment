Open it and install this after you download it. Once opened, download the file <b>wsiu4_6.lisp</b> by downloading the ZIP file in the clone or download tab and place it in anywhere on your computer as long you remember where you placed it. Once downloaded, go into the Allegro CL program and tell it to compile and load the file. <b>Go to file > compile & load.</b> It should create a <b>wsiu4_6.fasl</b> file.

Once you have loaded the fasl file, you may now begin playing the game. To start the game play, type in <b>(start-game)</b> in the left window on the allegro program exactly as shown in the instruction guide. Once you do that, the game starts and you can now attempt to win the game. 

There will be options to tell you ask for help by typing <b>“help”</b> or <b>“h”</b> or <b>“?”</b> and it will show you what commands you can do and how to type them. Good luck!
